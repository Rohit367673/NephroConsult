   - Deploy your website
   - Click "Verify" in Bing Webmaster Tools

   - Click "Verify"

4. **Submit Your Sitemap**
   - After verification, go to "Sitemaps" in the left menu
   - Click "Submit a sitemap"

  <meta name="msvalidate.01" content="YOUR_BING_VERIFICATION_CODE" />
  
  <!-- Add Bing-specific meta tags -->
  <meta name="bingbot" content="index, follow">
</head>
```

### Step 4: Deploy Updated Files

After making changes, deploy these files to your live website:
- ‚úÖ `sitemap.xml` (updated with today's date)
- ‚úÖ `BingSiteAuth.xml` (if using XML verification)
- ‚úÖ `index.html` (with Bing verification meta tag)

### Step 5: Submit to Bing IndexNow (Instant Indexing!)

Bing has a special API called "IndexNow" for instant indexing:

**Manual Submission:**
1. Go to: https://www.bing.com/indexnow
2. Enter your URL: `https://www.nephroconsultation.com`
3. Submit

**Or use this URL directly in your browser:**
```
https://www.bing.com/indexnow?url=https://www.nephroconsultation.com/&key=YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Step 6: Create Backlinks (Boost Bing Ranking)

Bing values backlinks heavily. Create profiles on:
- LinkedIn with your website link
