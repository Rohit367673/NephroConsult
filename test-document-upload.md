# Document Upload & Display Test

## 🎯 **What Was Fixed:**

### ✅ **Frontend Changes:**
1. **BookingPage.tsx**: Now sends actual uploaded file names instead of empty array
2. **AdminDashboard.tsx**: Enhanced document display with proper styling and actions
3. **Document Flow**: Added logging to track file processing

### ✅ **Backend Support:**
- Document names stored in `appointment.intake.documents`
- Admin service maps documents correctly from various sources
- Role authentication fixed for admin access

## 🧪 **Test Steps:**

### **Step 1: Upload Document During Booking**
1. Go to Book Appointment page
2. Fill patient info: 
   - Name: ROHIT
   - Email: rohit367@gmail.com
   - Phone: 7807932322
3. **Upload a document** in the "Upload Medical Documents" section
4. Complete booking process
5. **Check browser console** for: `📄 Sending document to backend: filename.png Size: xxxxx`

### **Step 2: Verify in Admin Panel**
1. Go to Admin Dashboard
2. Select the consultation
3. **Expected Results**:
   - Document section shows uploaded file
   - "View" and "Download" buttons available
   - File name matches uploaded document
   - No "No documents uploaded" message

### **Step 3: Document Actions**
1. Click **"View"** button → Should attempt to open document
2. Click **"Download"** button → Should trigger download
3. Console should show document handling logs

## 🔍 **Current Status:**

### **What's Working:**
- ✅ File upload UI in booking flow
- ✅ File names sent to backend 
- ✅ Admin panel document display
- ✅ Role authentication fixed
- ✅ Document view/download buttons

### **What Needs Real Files:**

- 📋 Real download/view functionality
- 📋 File size and type metadata

## 🚀 **Expected Console Logs:**

### **During Booking:**
```
